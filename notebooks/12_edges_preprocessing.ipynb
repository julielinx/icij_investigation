    "- the year as two digits and as four (15 and 2015)\n",
    "- the month and day represented as two digits and one (03 and 3)\n",
    "- no way to tell whether the day or month comes first (03/09/2015 could be March 9th or September 3rd, there are no digits in the non-year sections that are above 12)\n",

    "The fully numeric format isn't as easy, there are 3 different formats and no indication on whether the month or day comes first. Only consistent piece is that the year comes last.\n",

    "As we aren't making any real-world applicable decisions, we could just arbitrarily pick whether to parse the date as the day first. However, we can get a little more accurate.\n",

    "- Offshore Leaks data came from offshore entities incorporated through Portcullis Trustnet (based in the Cook Islands) and Commonwealth Limited (based in the British Virgin Islands). The islands both companies are based in typically use the DMY date format.\n",
    "- Panama Papers data came from a Panama law firm. Panama uses the MDY format.\n",
    "- Paradise Papers data comes from the most varied data sources. According to the IJIC website, this data comes from the corporate registeries from seven countries: Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Nevis, Cook Islands, Malta, and Samoa. However, looking at the unique sourceIDs, we can see Lebanon also included. Fortunately, all of those countries use the same date format except Samoa. Majority: DMY, Samoa: MDY\n",
